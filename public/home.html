                This project started as a capstone project while taking an Electrical and Electronics Engineering Technology program at Fanshaw College. The project involved designing and building 3 IoT devices: A smart light-switch, a smart door-lock, and a smart power bar. I purchased a DIY 3D printer and amidst a constant struggle to get reliable and high quality prints, I learned 3D design in 123D Design and Fusion 360 and have designed and built numerous things. (See "Projects -> 3D Printer" OR "Other -> 3D Prints" pages)

                The main learning outcomes from this project was a hands on learning experience with linux, network infrastructure, 3D design/printing, and coding. These devices ran on Raspberry Pi Zero W's and were running NodeJS applications on Raspian OS and were the foundations for the server running this web page.

                These devices were a first step on a journey. The web design was extremely poor, the hardware looked crammed into oversized cases
