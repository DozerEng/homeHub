                        This project started as a capstone project while taking an Electrical and Electronics Engineering Technology program at Fanshaw College. The project involved designing and building 3 IoT devices: A smart light-switch, a smart door-lock, and a smart power bar. I purchased a DIY 3D printer and amidst a constant struggle to get reliable and high quality prints, I learned 3D design in 123D Design and Fusion 360 and have designed and built numerous things. (See "Projects -> 3D Printer" OR "Other -> 3D Prints" pages)
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The main learning outcomes from this project was a hands on learning experience with linux, network infrastructure, 3D design/printing, and coding. These devices ran on Raspberry Pi Zero W's and were running NodeJS applications on Raspian OS and were the foundations for the server running this web page.

                    <p>
                        These devices were a first step on a journey. The web design was extremely poor, the hardware looked crammed into oversized cases
